### Hi there, I'm Bryan! (Bri for friends) 👋

I'm a self-taught web developer, just like most! (But I'm more passionate 😎)
- 🧑‍💻 Working at [EmployBridge](https://www.employbridge.com/) as a **ReactJS** front end developer
- 🆘 I love helping others, so I'm working on an amazing project called [Observe](https://www.lawrencecheniv.com/design1/observe)! 🔭


And here is a list of things I love to do but I dont have things to demo! (I guess is my To-Do list now 🤔)
- 📲 React Native Animations!
- 📈 Create desktop/phone productivy apps (React Native/Electron)


Here is a list of things I want to do:
- 🌱 Create a coding blog explaining cool animations and how to build them!
- 🎨 Showcase my love for design on [Dribble.com](https://dribbble.com/)


And here I would list all my side projects. (If I only finish one!)

> In my defense, I have help so many students to achieve their goals, that I have not had the time to build stuff!

Well, anyways... and here's the list of incomplete projects: 😭
- 📝 React Native Inspector! ([Repo](https://github.com/BryanEnid/React-Native-Logger))
