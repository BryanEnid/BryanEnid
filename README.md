### Hi there, I'm Bryan! (Bri for friends) 👋

I'm a self-taught web developer 😎
- 🧑‍💻 Working at [EmployBridge](https://www.employbridge.com/) as a **ReactJS** front end developer
- 🆘 I love helping others, so I'm working on an amazing project called [Observe](https://www.lawrencecheniv.com/design1/observe)! 🔭


And here is a list of things I love to do but I dont have things to demo! (I guess is my To-Do list now 🤔)
- 📲 React Native Animations!
- 📈 Create desktop/phone productivy apps (React Native/Electron)


Here is a list of things I want to do:
- 🌱 Create a coding blog explaining how to create cool animations and th elogic behind them.
- 🎨 Showcase my love for design on [Dribble.com](https://dribbble.com/)
- 🎸 I have a bachelor in Sound Engineering and I create music! I want to build a DAW for the Web compatible with native plugins


And here I would list all my side projects. (If I only finish one!)
